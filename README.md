# Chess Data Analysis

This data science project explores three datasets of chess games scraped from the internet. –ê diverse range of tools from the Python ecosystem is used to analyze the data and uncover meaningful trends.

## Project Structure
- **`data_acquisition_and_cleaning.ipynb:`**: scraping, preparing and cleaning the data
- **`data_exploration_and_analysis.ipynb:`**: exploration and analysis
